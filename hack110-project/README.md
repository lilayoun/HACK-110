Title: 
What Disney animal are you?

Description:
This quiz is modeled after a Buzzfeed quiz. The user will answer the questions, and then will give you a Disney character that is most like you.
(Currently, this quiz only results in four different kinds of characters (Morris, Abu, Sven, Fire Spirit) and only uses one of the seven questions to actually determine the animal.)
